<string name="d41">How many capital cities do you know that have a game Park with lion, rhino, cheetah, giraffe, zebra, buffalo and other wild animals wandering around completely freely? Nairobi has just this, and if you have time, the Nairobi National Park is well worth a visit. Although not on the same scale as other game parks around Kenya, (such as the Maasai Mara, Samburu, Tsavo and Amboseli) the Nairobi National Park is just perfect if you don\'t have time to get to them, or need something to do while in Nairobi. Early morning or late afternoon are the best times to see animals so why not enjoy a picnic breakfast or sun-downer in the park which you organise yourself or ask a taxi or tour company to arrange for you. The park is surrounded by housing developments, which you can see on the east side of the park. It creates interesting images of rhino grazing happily to a backdrop of urban sprawl.</string>

<string name="d42">The Karen Blixen Museum was originally the farm house owned by the Baron Blixen and his wife Karen (who wrote the book and film Out of Africa under her pen name, Isak Dinesen) The coffee farm was bought in 1917 by Baron Blixen and the house itself dates back to 1912. Of their 4500 acre farm, 600 acres were used for coffee farming. The architecture is typical of late 19th century which includes the spacious rooms, verandas, tile roof and stone construction typical of this period. Many original items are in the house which date back to these early days and many items were also featured in the film Out of Africa. The house became part of the National Museums of Kenya in 1985 and is a tranquil place to visit among an expanse of green lawns and gardens which were once the home of Karen Blixen until she returned to her home in Denmark 1931. She affectionately called the house "Bogani" or "Mbogani" meaning a house in the woods and her famous phrase "‘I had a farm in Africa at the foot of the Ngong Hills’ is what you will see when you visit. The Museum is open to the public every day and is gives a wonderfully nostalic look at the lives of these early settlers. Next door are the Karen Blixen Coffee Gardens, and within these gardens are the:</string>

<string name="d43">Owned by the National Museums of Kenya, and housed within a building that dates back to 1913, the Nairobi Gallery is a very cute and cosy gallery that hosts regular art exhibitions. The buildings is the old Provincial Commissioner\'s office building and was fondly referred to by the name of \'Hatches, Matches and Dispatches\' by the settler community because of the births, marriages and deaths that were recorded here. For those interested in "old Kenya", the Gallery gives a chance for visitors to see some of Nairobi\'s colonial past dating almost 100 years. With wooden door and window frames, beams in the ceiling the main focal point for this interesting building is the central hallway which is circular with a high domed ceiling. It makes a perfect starting point for any exhibition with 5 rooms leading from it and a wide hall for extra exhibition space.This unique building is right in the heart of Nairobi tucked discreetly away next to, and within the same compound as Nyayo House. It\'s well worth a visit and the people running the gallery are extremely welcoming and friendly.</string>

<string name="d44">Refurbished in 2009, the museum has an eclectic mix of mainly natural history exhibits together with an small art gallery and various temporary exhibits (often photography. Within the museum, there’s a small shop with interesting pan African artifacts, books and so on. The most exciting and popular exhibition areas would probably be the Early Man gallery which has an excellent exhibition of evolution and the fossilised remains of early man unearthed by the Leakey family (and others) in Turkana, Magadi and other areas of Kenya. The bird exhibition is also something not to miss with its enormous and fascinating collection of stuffed birds; from tiny hummingbirds up to the eagle collection and exotic looking stalks all of which are indigenous to Kenya. There’s an interesting collection of stuffed mammals downstairs, in an attractive room (but rather darkly lit ) with a balcony all around. Life size giraffe, zebra and elephant etc loom over the visitors and some interactive displays are fun for children. A rock art exhibition up stairs is small but interesting and there are also some interesting displays on the cultures of various tribes in Kenya.</string>
